Description: Treelets provides a novel construction of multi-scale bases that extends
        wavelets to non-smooth signals. It returns a multi-scale orthonormal 
	basis, where the final computed basis functions are supported 
	on nested clusters in a hierarchical tree.  Both the tree and
	the basis, which are constructed simultaneously, reflect the 
	internal structure of the data.
